# Contributing to the Book Review Service

We welcome contributions to the Book Review Service! To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process, please follow these guidelines.

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Create a copy of the project in your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone the repository:** Download the forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Set up the development environment:** Follow the instructions in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` to set up your local development environment.

## Branching Strategy

We use a feature branching strategy. This means:

*   **Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:** Branch off from the `main` branch. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feat/add-user-authentication`, `fix/broken-review-sorting`).
*   **Work on your feature or fix in your dedicated branch.**
*   **Keep your branch updated:** Regularly pull changes from the `main` branch to avoid merge conflicts.

## Making Changes

*   **Write clear and concise code:** Follow the project's code style guidelines (if any are defined).
*   **Write tests:** Ensure your changes are covered by appropriate tests. We aim for good test coverage.
*   **Run tests:** Make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request. See `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for instructions on running tests.
*   **Write clear commit messages:** Your commit messages should be descriptive and explain the purpose of each commit.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

When you're ready to submit your changes:

1.  **Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.**
2.  **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a new pull request from your feature branch to the `main` branch.
3.  **Provide a descriptive PR title and description:** Explain the changes you've made, the problem they solve, and any relevant context.
4.  **Reference related issues:** If your PR addresses an existing issue, link to it in the description (e.g., `Closes #123`).
5.  **Be responsive to feedback:** Be prepared to discuss your changes and make revisions based on feedback from maintainers.

## Code Review

All pull requests will be reviewed by a maintainer. The reviewer will check for code quality, adherence to guidelines, test coverage, and overall impact on the project.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is governed by a Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
