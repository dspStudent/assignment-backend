# Architecture of the Book Review Service

This document describes the architecture of the book review service, a Python project.

## Overview

The book review service is designed to allow users to submit, view, and manage book reviews. It follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

## Components

The main components of the book review service are:

1.  **API (Application Programming Interface):** This is the entry point for external interactions with the service. It handles incoming requests from users and routes them to the appropriate business logic. We use a web framework (e.g., FastAPI, Flask) to build the API.

2.  **Business Logic / Service Layer:** This layer contains the core business rules and logic of the application. It processes requests received from the API, interacts with the data access layer, and performs necessary operations related to book reviews.

3.  **Data Access Layer (DAL):** This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It provides an abstraction over the underlying database technology, allowing the business logic to interact with data without needing to know the specific database details. We use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like SQLAlchemy for this purpose.

4.  **Database:** This is where the application data, including book information and reviews, is stored persistently. We use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite).

## Interaction Flow

Here's a typical flow of how components interact when a user submits a new book review:

1.  A user sends a request to the API endpoint for submitting a review.
2.  The API receives the request, validates the input data, and passes it to the Business Logic layer.
3.  The Business Logic layer performs any necessary checks (e.g., user authentication, book existence) and then calls the Data Access Layer to save the new review.
4.  The Data Access Layer translates the request into database operations (e.g., an SQL INSERT statement) and executes it against the database.
5.  The database confirms the successful insertion.
6.  The Data Access Layer returns the result to the Business Logic layer.
7.  The Business Logic layer processes the result and returns a response to the API.
8.  The API formats the response (e.g., as JSON) and sends it back to the user.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the project.
*   **Web Framework:** [Specify the framework, e.g., FastAPI, Flask] for building the API.
*   **ORM:** [Specify the ORM, e.g., SQLAlchemy] for database interaction.
*   **Database:** [Specify the database, e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite] for data storage.
*   **Dependency Management:** [Specify the tool, e.g., Poetry, pip] for managing project dependencies.
*   **Testing Framework:** [Specify the framework, e.g., Pytest, unittest] for writing tests.

This architecture provides a clear separation of concerns, making the service more modular, testable, and easier to maintain and scale.
